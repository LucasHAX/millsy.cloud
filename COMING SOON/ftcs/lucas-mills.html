        <h2>Welcome to Flavour Tour by Lucas Mills</h2>

        <p>Hey there! I'm Lucas Mills, and I’m genuinely excited to have you join me on this incredible culinary adventure, <strong>Flavour Tour</strong>. Over the next few years, I’ve got some big plans—from starting a show to crafting state-of-the-art recipes, and exploring all things food and design. There's so much fun ahead, and I can't wait to share it with you!</p>

        <br>
        <h3>My Cooking Journey</h3>
        <p>My cooking journey started when I was around 13. I’d spend hours in the kitchen, experimenting with whatever flavors and ingredients I could find, trying to create something new. That’s when I realized food wasn’t just a hobby for me—it was a passion that’s only grown stronger over the years.</p>

        <p>I’ve been deeply influenced by chefs like The Notorious Chef and, of course, the legendary Gordon Ramsay. Add to that the rich, vibrant flavors of Southeast Asian cuisine, and I’m constantly amazed at how food can transform not only dishes but experiences.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Coding Meets Cooking</h3>
        <p>And it’s not just about cooking for me. I’m also really into computing, and here's something cool—you’re currently browsing a website that I designed and built myself. Sure, I had some help from online courses and tutorials, but all the coding and design? That’s all me.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>The Dish That Sparked My Passion</h3>
        <p>The dish that first lit that spark for me was curry—traditional Indian-English style. I love everything about it, from the spices to the richness of the sauce. In fact, my original curry recipe is just a click away (check out the link below). And while you're at it, you'll also find all of my other recipes there too—each one crafted with the same passion.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>My Love for Meat</h3>
        <p>But I don’t stop at curry. I’m also crazy about meat. Beef, chicken—you name it. My first deep dive into beef cooking was with a classic beef bourguignon, and my introduction to chicken mastery came through perfecting a smoky, sweet BBQ Korean Chicken.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
        <p>Now, let’s take a peek down the road—say 30 years from now. Where do I see myself? Hopefully standing in my own restaurant, <em>Elysian</em>, a brand I’ve dreamed up, created, and designed myself. I want it to be more than just a restaurant. I want it to be an experience that merges immersive food and design in ways people haven’t imagined yet.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Designing for Fun</h3>
        <p>When I’m not cooking or building websites, I’m all about design. Whether it's creating logos, branding concepts, or even sketching boats and cars, I love anything that challenges my creativity. It’s all part of who I am.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Stay Connected</h3>
        <p>So, if you're curious about what's next, I’d love for you to follow me on social media. There, you'll get updates, cooking tips, and even behind-the-scenes looks at my upcoming projects. Trust me, we’re just getting started.</p>
